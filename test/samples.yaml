# This is an example manifest file describing two samples. Each sample's library
# was sequenced in two runs and thus has two sets of paired-end FASTQs.
samples:
  naive_esc: 
    - fastq/naive_esc_1.r1.fastq.gz fastq/naive_esc_1.r2.fastq.gz
    - fastq/naive_esc_2.r1.fastq.gz fastq/naive_esc_2.r2.fastq.gz
  primed_esc:
    - fastq/primed_esc_1.r1.fastq.gz fastq/primed_esc_1.r2.fastq.gz
    - fastq/primed_esc_2.r1.fastq.gz fastq/primed_esc_2.r2.fastq.gz
